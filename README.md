## Quart Photo Site

A photo site made using Python3 asyncio with the Quart framework.

Made as an alternative for people who want to self-host their photos without relying on
BigTechâ„¢ like flickr or instagram.

Hacked together in 2 days so code quality is questionable at times (but it is secure).

[Live example](https://photo.sanderf.nl/)
